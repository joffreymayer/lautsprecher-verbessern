// In order to make this running correctly:
//  1) Make sure to reference this JS-File correctly at the top of your HTML-File (don't forget to add a "defer"-statement ion the script-Tag, otherwise it will be loaded BEFORE the rendered content, which is bad!)
//  2) Make sure to add the 'data-lazy' on each <img>-Element INSTEAD of the 'src'-attribute, otherwise you will not see any animation (because wa added also css that hides all images at the beginning.)
//  3) Add the CSS from the video in order to make the CSS-animation work.

const targets = document.querySelectorAll('img.lazy'); // Select all the <img>-Elements with the class "lazy"

const lazyLoad = target => {
    // We use the IntersectionObserver()-API in order to get the lazy-loading job done (= the 'IntersectionObserver API' allows us to call a function on Scrolling, e.g. basically a ScrollTrigger Event for ANY device! :D):
    const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => { // entries == Describes, whether we see a change in the "Zustand" of each of the target-HTML-element (= our images we want to lazy-load), e.g. whether the image has intersected with the viewport (--> if yes, then the Zustand becomes "true" and we lazy-load the images, otherwise "false" and no image is loaded).
        entries.forEach(entry => {
            console.log('üòç')

            if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                const img = entry.target;
                const src = img.getAttribute('data-lazy');

                img.setAttribute('src', src);
                img.classList.add('lazy-fade'); // add new class that will make the image visible

                observer.disconnect(); // This will disconnect the observer (= we don't need to target the images anymore, AFTER they have been lazy-loaded!), after the image gets visible, in order to not overload the main thread in the browser.
            }
        })
    }); 

    io.observe(target);
}

targets.forEach(lazyLoad); //Call the function 'lazyLoad' on each image.

// NEW: Let's also lazy-load the images that are inside of <picture>-elements. 
// --> The Set-Up in order for you to run the code below:
// 1) In your HTML-file, simply put the 'lazy-picture'-class onto the <picture>-element that you want to lazy-load.
// 2) In  your HTML-file, also put the "lazy"-class onto the <img>-Tag that is situated WITHIN the <picture>-element you want to lazy-load.
const lazySource = document.querySelectorAll('.lazy-picture > source'); // Selects all direct children of each <picture>-elements --> goal: we want all the <source>-element within each <picture>, because we need to replace the "srcset"-attributes!
// console.log(lazySource); // check if it worked? --> Yes!

const lazyLoadPicture = target => {
    // We use the IntersectionObserver()-API in order to get the lazy-loading job done (= the 'IntersectionObserver API' allows us to call a function on Scrolling, e.g. basically a ScrollTrigger Event for ANY device! :D):
    const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => { // entries == Describes, whether we see a change in the "Zustand" of each of the target-HTML-element (= our images we want to lazy-load), e.g. whether the image has intersected with the viewport (--> if yes, then the Zustand becomes "true" and we lazy-load the images, otherwise "false" and no image is loaded).

                const src = source.getAttribute('data-srcset');

                source.setAttribute('srcset', src);
                source.classList.add('lazy-fade'); // add new class that will make the image visible
